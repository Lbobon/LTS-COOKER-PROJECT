# üç≥ Cooker - AI-Powered Cooking Assistant

Cooker is a project I built in collaboration with my teammates during the LTS AI Summer Camp. After learning broadly about different AI technologies, focusing on LLMs, Agentic AI from IBM Watsonx, LuxProvide environment to train models, and more, we decided to build a web application in less than 48 hours that combines barcode scanning, AI-powered recipe generation, and intelligent shopping list creation. Built with Flask, Ollama, and modern web technologies.

I was responsible for the backend, frontend, and AI model integration - essentially the coding part of the project - while my teammates focused on sourcing datasets, innovative ideas, designs using Figma, and ensuring the project's feasibility and usefulness.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: To use this project, you will need a local instance of Ollama running and the Walmart grocery database. Please download the dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/product-prices-and-sizes-from-walmart-grocery) and place it in the project folder.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

We would love for people to try our project and provide feedback. Here's how to set it up:

### **1. Clone/Download Project**
```bash
# Option A: Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd LTS-COOKER-PROJECT

# Option B: Download and extract ZIP
# Navigate to project folder
cd LTS-COOKER-PROJECT
```

### **2. Install Ollama & AI Model**

#### **Install Ollama**
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
winget install Ollama.Ollama
# OR download from: https://ollama.ai/download

# macOS
brew install ollama
# OR download from: https://ollama.ai/download

# Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

#### **Pull Required Model**
```bash
# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# In new terminal, pull the model
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b

# Verify installation
ollama list
```

*Note: If you want to use a different model, you can change the model name in the backend.py file and then pull the model again. However, after multiple rounds of testing, the Qwen model provided the perfect balance between speed and accuracy.*

### **3. Setup Python Environment**

#### **Create Virtual Environment**
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Required packages:**
- `Flask==3.0.0` - Web framework
- `Flask-CORS==4.0.0` - Cross-origin support
- `requests==2.31.0` - HTTP requests
- `beautifulsoup4==4.12.2` - Web scraping
- `pandas==2.1.4` - Data processing

### **4. Verify Data Files**
Ensure these files are present:
- ‚úÖ `WMT_Grocery_202209.csv` (171MB) - Main product database
- ‚úÖ `mouse.png` & `cooker.png` - UI assets

*Click the image above to watch our demo video on YouTube*

### **Basic Workflow**
1. **Open** http://localhost:8000
2. **Ask for ingredients**: Type "pizza" or "chocolate chip cookies", or whatever dish name you have in mind
3. **Generate shopping list**: Click "üõí Generate Shopping List"
4. **Get recipes**: Wait for recipe generation to finish
5. **Get shopping list**: Wait for shopping list generation to finish
6. **View shopping list**: Click on the "View My Cart" button

4. **Product automatically added** to ingredients list

### **AI Recipe Generation**
1. **Switch to dark mode** (toggle button)
2. **Scan ingredients** using camera
3. **Ask for recipe**: "Make me a recipe with these ingredients"
4. **AI generates** complete recipe with instructions
